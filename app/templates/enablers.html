                        Raymond Samuel Tomlinson was the computer programmer who invented email. His employer, Bolt,
                        Beranek and Newman, worked on projects for ARPAnet, the predecessor of the Internet. In 1971, he
                        sent the first email, including an “@” symbol to designate an address, to another computer
                        across the room.

                        William Henry Gates III was a co-founder with Paul Allen of the software company Microsoft. In
                        1975, he
                        dropped out of Harvard to run the company that put the operating system DOS on every IBM
                        personal computer.
                        Following Apple’s lead, they later developed “Windows”, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the
                        operating
                        system. Microsoft continued to thrive with its Office suite, Internet Explorer and Edge web
                        browsers, and
                        Xbox video games.

                        Paul Gardner Allen was a computer scientist who partnered with his childhood friend Bill Gates
                        to create
                        Microsoft. Together, they helped to usher in the personal computer revolution. His initial
                        project was to
                        write the BASIC programming language to be used on Altair’s microcomputer. In 1980, they
                        licensed to IBM the
                        MS-DOS operating system, which quickly became the dominant one for personal computers. He left
                        the company
                        in 1983, becoming active in philanthropy and technology investing.

                        Steven Paul Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. in 1976. With co-founder Steve Wozniak, Jobs created one
                        of the first commercially successful personal computers. In the early 1980s, Jobs introduced a
                        mouse-driven
                        GUI (Graphical User Interface) on the Macintosh personal computer, and Apple stayed in the
                        forefront
                        of hardware and software development. He was forced to leave Apple in 1985, but returned as CEO
                        in 1997,
                        when Apple bought his company NeXT. Apple went on to pioneer the iPhone in 2007, sparking the
                        rise of the
                        mobile Internet.
