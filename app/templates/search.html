            As Web content exploded, users found it increasingly challenging to find what they were looking for. In
            1990, Archie introduced an FTP site with an index of downloadable directory listings. Directory listings
            dominated until software was developed to crawl and index websites.

                        Excite was one of the first search engines to process natural language queries. It launched in
                        1995, along
                        with AltaVista and a host of less-known sites like MetaCrawler. Excite began as a university
                        project by six
                        Stanford students in 1993. They analyzed statistical relationships of word patterns to search
                        the Internet.
                        As Excite grew, it acquired competitors WebCrawler and Magellan in 1996. Several years later,
                        Excite had
                        partnered with MSN and Netscape to provide search services. In 1999, Excite was acquired by
                        broadband
                        provider @Home.com for $6.5 billion and renamed Excite@Home. Excite rapidly lost search traffic
                        to Google
                        following its launch, and Excite@Home filed for bankruptcy in October 2001. InfoSpace bought its
                        assets and
                        trademarks for $10 million, and Ask Jeeves purchased the Excite.com portal in 2004.

                        Lycos was another search engine and web portal established in 1994. It was spun out of a
                        research project by
                        Michael Loren Mauldin of Carnegie Mellon University. It categorized keywords with prefixes and
                        word
                        proximity, and the new company focused on making the company an ad-supported Web portal. Lycos
                        enjoyed rapid
                        growth and went public in 1996 with a market value of $300 million. By 1999, Lycos had become
                        the most
                        visited page on the Web, with a presence in more than 40 countries. In 2000, Lycos was acquired
                        for $12.5
                        billion by Terra Networks, part of the Spanish telecom company Telefónica. As Google attained
                        dominance,
                        Lycos abandoned its search engine and was sold in 2004 to Daum Communications in Korea as a
                        collection of
                        entertainment and social networking websites.

                        With an idea sparked by their fantasy basketball league, Stanford graduate students David Filo
                        and Jerry
                        Yang launched "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web" in 1994. It comprised a
                        human-edited directory
                        of the World Wide Web. As its popularity grew, they changed the name to Yahoo! With an
                        investment from
                        Sequoia Capital, Yahoo! quickly became the most popular online directory and search engine on
                        the Web. As
                        its portal expanded into content and other services, Yahoo! lost site of its search function,
                        eventually
                        ceding that ground to Google. After rejecting a $47 bn takeover offer from Microsoft in 2008,
                        Yahoo!
                        eventually sold itself to Verizon in 2016 for less than $5 bn.

                        AskJeeves focused on the use of human editors for search queries. It was launched in 1997 by
                        Garret Gruener
                        and David Warthen. Unlike Yahoo, AltaVista, and Excite, AskJeeves did not focus on keywords. It
                        interpreted
                        the natural language of a question, yielding more relevant results. The site rapidly gained
                        favor with the
                        growing number of non-technical Web users. AskJeeves’ human editors catalogued prominent
                        websites, alongside
                        paid listings and partner sites. Starting in 2000, AskJeeves developed its own search technology
                        through the
                        acquisitions of Direct Hit in 2000, Teoma in 2001, and Excite in 2004. AskJeeves was acquired by
                        Barry
                        Diller’s InterActiveCorp (IAC) in 2005, but with its emphasis on paid listings, it struggled to
                        compete
                        against Google, Yahoo!, and MSN Search. The site was rebranded to Ask.com in 2006 and licenced
                        its search
                        function to another provider in 2010.

                        Google was the brainchild of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford PhD students who attempted
                        to catalog
                        and search the new World Wide Web. They developed an algorithm that analyzed web page relevance,
                        based on
                        the links connecting pages to each other. They launched Google on Stanford’s website
                        (google.stanford.edu)
                        in 1996, and the traffic overwhelmed Stanford’s network. After failing to licence the technology
                        to another
                        search site, they launched Google.com in 1997 with the backing of several Silicon Valley angel
                        investors.
                        While it featured a simple homepage, Google made its mission to “organize all the world’s
                        information”. With
                        radically better search technology, Google quickly became the Internet’s most powerful search
                        engine. In
                        1999, AOL selected Google as its search partner. Google now generates over $60 bn of annual
                        revenue from
                        advertising, cloud computing, software, and hardware sales.

                        As the search category thrived, Microsoft introduced MSN Search in 1998. MSN used Inktomi
                        technology (which
                        also powered Yahoo!) and for a short time, AltaVista. Microsoft developed the ancestor of its
                        search engine
                        in 2004, embedded in its browser. MSN Search was renamed Windows Live in 2006. Microsoft
                        licensed its
                        technology to other web portals, search engines and ISPs. In 2009, Microsoft launched Bing as a
                        direct
                        competitor to Google. Bing’s algorithm placed inline search suggestions for related searches
                        directly in the
                        result set. Bing launched Social Sidebar in 2012, which showed results through the lens of user
                        social
                        networks. Bing released a mobile-friendly algorithm update in 2015. Today Bing is the
                        second-largest search
                        engine worldwide with over 14 billion monthly search queries.

                        As a backlash emerges regarding user privacy, a new generation of search engines is evolving
                        that don’t
                        track a user’s search history. DuckDuckGo was founded by Gabriel Weinberg in 2008. Coming off a
                        failed
                        social networking start-up, the site’s search results were mostly APIs of other search engines
                        results. In
                        DuckDuckGo’s model, user searches weren’t tracked like other search engines. The site attracted
                        a small, but
                        loyal following of privacy-concerned users. Union Square Ventures invested in the company in
                        2011 to support
                        private search engines, and by 2013, DuckDuckGo was serving 4 million searches per day. Firefox
                        and Safari
                        offered DuckDuckGo as a default search engine option in their browsers in 2014, and Google
                        Chrome followed
                        suit in 2019. DuckDuckGo now answers over 100 million searches per day, making revenue from ads
                        that don’t
                        involve tracking individual users.

                        Launched in 2021, the Neeva search engine was founded by former Google executives, Sridhar
