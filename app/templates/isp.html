                        America Online (AOL) - This private networking service first went online in November 1985 as
                        PlayNET. The company
                        went public in 1993, and edged out Prodigy and CompuServe to become the largest online service
                        in 1995, with
                        three million subscribers. New membership offers and CD-ROMs were ubiquitous, through direct
                        mailings and
                        partnership give-aways with products and event tickets. Early users of the dial-up service paid
                        hourly connection fees,
                        which later evolved into a flat monthly fee of $19.95.
                        In 2001, with 30 million users, and near the peak of its market capitalization, AOL acquired
                        media
                        conglomerate Time Warner Corporation, which at $360 billion was the largest merger in history.
                        After suffering rapid
                        subscriber declines resulting from the growth of broadband and the World Wide Web, AOL was spun
                        off from Time Warner in
                        2009. It was acquired by the phone company Verizon in 2015 for $4.4 billion, which subsequently
                        sold it (and
                        Yahoo!) to the private equity firm Apollo for $5 billion.

                        Compuserve - Founded in 1969, Compuserve was one of the first online services. Spun out of the
                        Golden United
                        Life Insurance company in 1975, it evolved from a business network to a fee-driven, dial-up
                        consumer network. H&R
                        Block acquired the company in 1980. The dial-up “walled garden” service offered email, online
                        chats, online
                        forums, software libraries and online games. Compuserve also introduced the .gif format for
                        pictures. Its membership
                        peaked in the early 1990s at around 3 million subscribers, and the subscriber service was
                        acquired by rival AOL in
                        1997.

                        Prodigy - A joint venture between CBS, IBM, and Sears, Prodigy began service in 1984, as the use
                        of personal
                        computers began to explode. It offered a user-friendly selection of news, weather, sports,
                        message boards
                        and many other services. It was also a pioneer in online shopping and advertising. Bundled with
                        sales of IBM’s PS1
                        and PS2 personal computers, by 1990, Prodigy had accumulated almost a million subscribers. The
                        company was acquired
                        by the newly-formed International Wireless in 1996 for $200 million, and went public in 1999. It
                        was acquired in
                        2001 by SBC Communications, and later merged into Yahoo!.

                        GEnie - The global conglomerate General Electric formed an online service in 1985 that utilized
                        its GE
                        mainframe computers during their down-time. GEnie (General Electric Network for Information
                        Exchange) never received
                        much investment by its parent, and was slow to increase capacity and integrate new features. In
                        1996, GE sold
                        GEnie to Yovelle, which was later acquired by IDT Corporation. Peaking at only a few hundred
                        thousand users, IDT shut
                        down GEnie at the end of 1999.

                        MSN - Microsoft was late to offer its own service, MSN (the Microsoft Network) in 1995,
                        alongside its
                        Windows 95 release. It was initially a dial-up service, which branched into a range of products
                        and services for
                        Windows devices. In 1998, the subscription model was retooled, and MSN transformed into a free
                        web portal that
                        serves as a collection of Internet services and Microsoft apps.
