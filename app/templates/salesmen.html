                        As electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford, in 1994, David Filo and Jerry Yang
                        launched the
                        website "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web". The site was a human-edited directory
                        of the new
                        and expanding World Wide Web, As its popularity grew, they changed the name to Yahoo!, as an
                        acronym for
                        “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle” ans incorporated the company in 1995. They
                        integrated a search
                        engine called Yahoo Search, which quickly became the most popular online directory and search
                        engine on the
                        Web. After rejecting a $47 bn takeover offer from Microsoft in 2008, Yahoo! eventually sold
                        itself to
                        Verizon in 2016 for less than $5 bn.

                        In 1995, Craig Newmark started an email list in San Francisco featuring events and other
                        classified ad
                        content. In 1996, he transformed it into the simple Website Craiglist that quickly exploded in
                        popularity
                        around the country, significantly disrupting newspaper classified advertising. Today the free

                        huge collection of local ads for everything from collectibles to cars to dating. In 2004, eBay
                        acquired 25%
                        of Craigslist. Newmark spends most of his time today on philanthropic initiatives.

                        Jimmy Donal Wales worked at a futures trading firm, while coding in his spare time. He used his
                        trading
                        profits to launch an unsuccessful content/search engine, but then turned his attention to
                        creating an online
                        encyclopedia. In 2001, to supplement content creation for the initiative, he and partner Larry
                        Sanger
                        launched Wikipedia, an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that allowed content
                        contributions from
                        ordinary people. The site’s popularity grew quickly, and today is one of the Internet's most

                        hosting over 57 million articles in over 300 languages. Wikipedia operates as a non-profit, and

                        remains on the board of trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation. He also co-founded the for-profit

                        In 1999, programmer Shawn Fanning developed Napster, a peer-to-peer file-sharing program that
                        allowed users
                        to find and trade music files online. At its peak, the free service had more than 25 million
                        users.
                        Following an avalanche of lawsuits from the music industry and copyright holders, Napster was
                        ordered to
                        shut down in 2001. Napster initiated the digital music revolution, and
                        Fanning later launched a paid version of the site, which was acquired by Rhapsody in 2011.

                        Mark Elliot Zuckerberg launched the social media website Facebook from his dorm room at Harvard
                        in 2004. He
                        soon left college to launch a company and expanded the service to other campuses. The site
                        allowed students
                        to connect with each other, share photos and videos, chat, and join interest groups. Facebook
                        opened the
                        platform to the general public, and with 845 million monthly users, Facebook went public in 2012
                        at a
                        valuation of $104 billion. Zuckerberg remains CEO of Facebook, which has grown to nearly 3

                        Lawrence Edward Page and Sergey Mikhaylovich Brin were two Stanford PhD students who started
                        work in a
                        friend's garage attempting to catalog and search the new World Wide Web. They developed an
                        algorithm that
                        analyzed web page relevance, based on the links connecting pages to each other. “Google”
                        initially launched
                        on Stanford’s website (google.stanford.edu) in 1996, and became Google.com in 1997. Their
                        algorithm was
                        superior to existing ones, and Google quickly became the Internet’s most powerful search engine.
                        Google now
                        generates over $60 bn of annual revenue from advertising, cloud computing, software, and

                        Amazon continued to expand into e-readers, virtual home assistants and streaming video. Its AWS
